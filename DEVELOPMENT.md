# Development

This document describes how to develop for Passport.  The instructions below describe how to set up the development environment and build Passport on a system running **Ubuntu 20.04**.  This OS is used for official Passport builds, as well as in the Dockerfile described below which creates reproducible builds.

## Setup
In order to build the Passport firmware, you need to:

* Get the source code
* Install the dependencies
* Run the build or sign command

## Contributing
Foundation requires commits to be signed with GPG keys in order to be merged. Follow [Github's guide to commit signature verification](https://docs.github.com/en/authentication/managing-commit-signature-verification) to get started.

### Get the Source Code
The instructions below assume you are installing into your home folder at `~/passport2`.  You can choose
to install to a different folder, and just update command paths appropriately.

    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/passport2.git

### Install Dependencies
Several tools are required for building Passport.

#### Install Rust Toolchain

First install the `rustup` tool from [rustup.rs](https://rustup.rs/).

Then run the following commands:

    rustup default 1.67.1

    # For the simulator. Only if on macOS with an M1 CPU.
    rustup target add aarch64-unknown-none 
    
    rustup target add thumbv7em-none-eabihf
    cargo install cbindgen

#### Cross-Compiler Toolchain
The cross-compiler enables your PC to build code for the STM32H753 MCU used by Passport.  Use the following commands to install and build the cross-compiler and MicroPython tools.

    sudo apt install gcc-arm-none-eabi
    cd ~/passport2
    make -C mpy-cross

#### Autotools
The makefiles used by MicroPython and Passport firmware use Autotools.  Install Autotools and related packages with the following command:

    sudo apt install autotools-dev automake libusb-1.0-0-dev libtool python3-virtualenv libsdl2-dev pkg-config curl

#### OpenOCD - On-Chip Debugger
OpenOCD is used to connect to the STLink V2 debug probe.  Note that this is only required for developers with a special Developer version of the Passport board.  If all you want to do is build the firmware and install it with a Developer Pubkey over microSD, then you do not need to install OpenOCD.

    cd ~/
    git clone https://github.com/ntfreak/openocd.git
    cd ~/openocd/
    ./bootstrap
    ./configure --enable-stlink
    make
    sudo make install


## Building Passport Firmware
Passport comes with a set of `Justfile` command scripts.  Using these commands requires that you first install the `just` command runner by either following the instructions at [github.com/casey/just#installation](https://github.com/casey/just#installation) or using 
    
    cargo install just 
    
Note that Python `Pillow` must be updated to `8.4.0` for all commands to work properly using the following command:

    pip install Pillow==8.4.0

`ports/stm32/Justfile` contains all the `just` commands you can run to build firmware for Passport. You'll typically want to be in the `ports/stm32` folder to run these commands.

**Make sure to replace the version number used in this guide (2.2.0) with the software version number you're building**

To build and sign the firmware with a Developer Pubkey, use one of the following commands. Note: you cannot sign with Developer Pubkey until you've completed the [code-signing](https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/passport2/blob/main/DEVELOPMENT.md#code-signing) steps:

    just sign 2.2.0 color
    just sign 2.2.0 mono

If you just want to build without signing, use one of the following commands:

    just build color
    just build mono

There are other `just` command as well, but most are only useful to developers who have the Developer board with a connection to an STLink V2 debug probe.

    just clean                    # Cleans exisiting compiled binaries
    just flash 2.2.0 color <dev>  # Builds, signs, and flashes firmware to a device using a connected STLink
    just sign-beta 2.2.0 3        # Builds and signs all combinations of color, mono, normal, and dev firmwares, with a beta number

#### Building the Simulator
First, install xterm

    sudo apt install xterm

Next, make sure you are in the simulator folder:

    cd simulator

Then run one of the simulator `just` commands:

    just sim color
    just sim mono


#### Code Signing
In order to load the files onto the device, they need to first be signed either by two separate keys (for Foundation's official updates), or by a Developer Pubkey if you are signing your own custom builds.  Since you are probably not a developer at Foundation, we'll just describe the process for the Developer Pubkey below.

Foundation developed a tool called `cosign`, which we use internally to double-sign official firmware, and which you can use to sign with a Developer Pubkey.

First, you need to build the `cosign` tool and copy it somewhere in your `PATH`:

    sudo apt install libssl-dev
    cd ports/stm32/boards/Passport/tools/cosign
    make
    cp x86/release/cosign ~/.local/bin   # You can run `echo $PATH` to see the list of possible places you can put this file

If you don't already have an openssl key, return to the repo root directory (e.g. `~/passport2`) and generate a Pubkey using `tools/genkeys.sh`. This takes a key number as an argument.

    ./tools/genkeys.sh 1

Now, move the keys into `~/bin/keys/`, or look ahead a few steps for instructions on setting a custom `cosign_keypath`. Create the directory if it doesn't exist yet. If you already have keys here for another use, make sure not to overwrite them. Make sure not to commit these keys in the git repo.

    mkdir -p ~/bin/keys
    mv 1.pem ~/bin/keys/user.pem
    mv 1-pub.bin ~/bin/keys/user-pub.bin
    mv 1-pub.pem ~/bin/keys/user-pub.pem

Next, save `user-pub.bin` to a microSD card, and upload it to the passport by inserting the microSD, going to the leftmost settings page, and selecting Advanced -> Developer Pubkey -> Install Pubkey, then selecting user-pub.bin.

Next you need to sign the firmware and give it a version number.  Once signed, `cosign` will output a filename of the format `v2.1.0-passport.bin`, but with the version number
replaced with whatever you specified.  Note that you need to tell `cosign` whether you are signing for a `mono` (Founder's Edition) Passport or a `color` (Batch 2 onward) Passport.

First, make sure you're in the proper directory

    cd ~/passport2/port/stm32

then

    cosign -f build-Passport/firmware-COLOR.bin -k mykeys/user-pub.pem -t color -v 2.2.0

or

    cosign -f build-Passport/firmware-MONO.bin -k mykeys/user-pub.pem -t mono -v 2.2.0

Note that the `Justfile` in `ports/stm32` contains a `just sign` command that you can use just by placing your private key in `~/bin/keys/user.pem`.  Alternatively, you can
customize the location by setting `cosign_keypath` at the top of the `Justfile`.

    just sign 2.2.0 color

You can also print the contents of the firmware header with the following command:

    cosign -f build-Passport/firmware-signed-signed.bin -p -t color

The signed firmware can be put onto a microSD card and installed on Passport.  You just need to upload the corresponding Developer Pubkey first.

#### Building the Bootloader
To build the bootloader for a reproducibility check, go to the repo root folder:

    cd ~/passport2

Then run one of the following commands to build the corresponding bootloader:

    just build-bootloader color
    just build-bootloader mono

Please note that building the mono bootloader is not yet supported in this repository.  If you need to build it, please follow the instructions at:

https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/passport-firmware
