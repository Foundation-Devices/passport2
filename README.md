# Passport Wallet Firmware

Passport is an ultra-secure, open source hardware wallet for Bitcoin that offers excellent usability and a great design.

Get yours at [foundationdevices.com](https://foundationdevices.com) and [follow @FOUNDATIONdvcs on Twitter](https://twitter.com/FOUNDATIONdvcs) to keep up with the latest updates and security alerts.

## Project Structure

The source code is organized according to the standard MicroPython project structure.

The source is, broadly speaking, split into two parts:

-   **Bootloader** - This is typically flashed into the device permanently at the factory, although we may release developer versions of Passport that allow users to flash their own bootloader.

-   **Main Firmware** - This is the main, updatable software running on Passport that provides the UI and wallet features.

Code specific to Passport is included in the following folders:

-   [`ports/stm32`](ports/stm32) Low-level platform configuration for MicroPython.
-   [`ports/stm32/boards/Passport`](ports/stm32/boards/Passport) C files that implement some device drivers and code that was 5-10 times faster in C than in Python.
    -   [`bootloader`](ports/stm32/boards/Passport/bootloader) C-based code that handles secure element initialization, firmware validation and updates, and system startup.
    -   [`common`](ports/stm32/boards/Passport/common) Common C code shared between the bootloader and the main firmware.
    -   [`images`](ports/stm32/boards/Passport/images) Images and a build script that converts the images to C data for LVGL to load.
    -   [`modules`](ports/stm32/boards/Passport/modules) The MicroPython code that implements the user interface and menu actions.
    -   [`trezor-firmware`](extmod/trezor-firmware) Contains a copy of the Trezor source code in order to use Trezor's crypto library. Only a small subset of this source code is included in Passport.
    -   [`tools`](ports/stm32/boards/Passport/tools) - Folder that contains the following tools for Passport development
        -   [`add-secrets`](ports/stm32/boards/Passport/tools/add-secrets) - Simple tool for Foundation developers to append Secure Element secrets to the bootloader when testing new versions.
        -   [`cosign`](ports/stm32/boards/Passport/tools/cosign) - A C-based utility that implements the code signing that keeps Passport's firmware safe.
        -   [`pubkey-to-c`](ports/stm32/boards/Passport/tools/pubkey-to-c) - A C-based utility that converts a pubkey to a C data structure for inclusion in the firmware and bootloader.
        -   [`se_config_gen`](ports/stm32/boards/Passport/tools/se_config_gen) - Tool for specifying how Passport will use the slots of the Secure Element and generating the configuration data to pass to the chip during provisioning.  The conriguration gets locked down during provisioning and cannot be changed.
        -   [`version_info`](ports/stm32/boards/Passport/tools/version_info) - A simple bash script for creating a date and version number available in C.
        -   [`word_list_gen`](ports/stm32/boards/Passport/tools/word_list_gen) - Simple utility for creating optimized word lookup metadata for BIP-39 and bytewords.
 
## Development

Please see [`DEVELOPMENT.md`](DEVELOPMENT.md) for information on developing for Passport.

## Verifying Firmware SHA Sums

To make building and verifying the firmware a simple process, there is a Dockerfile in the project that builds an image to be used to build the firmware. Using [`just`](https://github.com/casey/just), the following command can be used to verify the reproducability of the firmware. Make sure to substitute `<the sha sum>` for the SHA string to verify.

```shell
just verify-sha <the-sha-sum>
```
Those who wish to see further into this process can look at and run the following commands:

    just build-docker
    just build-firmware color
    just build-bootloader
    shasum -b -a 256 ports/stm32/build-Passport/firmware-COLOR.bin


## Open Source Components

Passport's firmware incorporates open-source software from several third-party projects, as well as other first-party work we open-sourced.

-   [MicroPython](https://github.com/micropython/micropython) - This forms the core foundation on which Passport is built.

-   [LVGL for MicroPython](https://github.com/lvgl/lv_micropython) - LVGL is an embedded GUI framework written in C.  LVGL is used to draw all the screens in the main Passport firmware.  Passport uses LVGL via the `lv_micropython` repo, which provides a complete Python interface to LVGL.

-   [Coldcard Firmware](https://github.com/Coldcard/firmware) - Passport's security model has a lot in common with Coldcard, and the Passport firmware was originally based directly on the ColdCard repository. As development progressed, however, we chose to follow MicroPython best practices and start with a fresh MicroPython repository. We've ported numerous files from Coldcard as needed, and we thank them for their great contribution to open source.

-   [Trezor Firmware](https://github.com/trezor/trezor-firmware) - Trezor has kindly open-sourced a highly-optimized library of crypto algorithms. Rather than modify the Trezor code, we decided to include the original source. This will make it easier to incorporate future improvements and fixes from Trezor and their contributors. We may convert this to a git submodule in the future.

-   [Quirc](https://github.com/dlbeer/quirc) - Quirc is a QR decoding library that offers an embedded-friendly interface to process images from a camera for QR codes. This library has proven to be fast and reliable in Passport. We made some changes and contributed back to Quirc (pull request pending).

-   [QRCode](https://github.com/ricmoo/QRCode) - QRCode is a QR code creator library that takes a string or data and encode it to a QR code which can then be displayed on screen, saved to file, etc. This library has a simple clean interface and was easy to integrate.

-   [Foundation UR Python 2.0](https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/foundation-ur-py) - This is our Python port of the UR 2.0 standard from the wonderful Blockchain Commons. It provides the ability to encode/decode multi-part animated QR codes that represent data which is too large to fit in a single QR code. This is the new standard air-gapped wallets are expected to adopt moving forward.

-   [Foundation UR Python 1.0](https://github.com/Foundation-Devices/foundation-ur-py) - This is Foundation's Python port of the UR 1.0 standard from BlockChain Commons. It has the same goals as UR 2.0, but was more of an early experiment. Foundation Devices ported this to Python to be compatible with air-gapped software wallets like BlueWallet and Specter.  This standard is out of date and deprecated.  Foundation intends to remove support for UR 1.0 in the near future.
