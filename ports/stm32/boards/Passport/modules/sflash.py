# sflash.py - SPI Flash
#
# Layout for project:
#   - 917K PSBT incoming (MAX_TXN_LEN)
#   - 917K PSBT outgoing (MAX_TXN_LEN)
#   - The previous two regions are only used when signing PSBTs.
#   - The same space is also used to hold firmware updates.
#   - 256k flash cache - similar to settings, but for UTXOs and wallet address cache
