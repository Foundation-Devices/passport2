//! FFI bindings to the MicroPython STM32 port.
//!
//! These bindings do not use rust-bindings to decrease the complexity of the
//! build-system, mainly because the preprocessing steps of MicroPython are
//! too complicated as it first requires preprocessing all of the code for
//! extracting QSTRs, etc.
//!
//! The aim of this module is to keep it simple and detect which types are
//! really needed so keep an interface with MicroPython as minimal as
//! possible.
//!
//! Code that depends on preprocessor assumptions should be documented
//! properly.
//!
//! FIXME: If there's enough interest for replacing more MicroPython code
//! in the future one could start by removing the bindings for SPI, Pin,
//! etc. and handle those in pure Rust with embedded-hal and stm32h7xx-hal
//! maybe.
//!
//! That would require porting code that interacts with most devices to Rust
//! first.
